Machine Learning Techniques
Supervised Learning: Involves training models on labeled datasets to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs, enabling predictions on new data. Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines
Reinforcement Learning: Enables an agent to make decisions by acting in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It is widely applied in robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems
Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabelled data to find patterns or structures, commonly for clustering and association tasks with algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.

Applications of Machine Learning
Disease Diagnosis: Machine learning algorithms analyze medical data, including X-rays, MRIs, and patient records, to aid healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases and improving accuracy. Deep learning models are effective in identifying tumors in imaging
Fraud Detection: Financial institutions use machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing transaction data patterns. Algorithms learn from historical data to identify anomalies and flag suspicious activities in real-time
Recommendation Systems: E-commerce platforms utilize machine learning to provide personalized product recommendations to users by analyzing customer behavior, purchase history, and preferences

Advancements in Machine Learning
Deep Learning: Artificial neural networks have achieved better performance than many earlier methods in machine learning
Evolving Field: Machine learning is continually evolving, with advancements in deep learning, transfer learning, and automated machine learning (AutoML) fueling new innovations and applications across diverse fields
